/*
You are given a string s consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b'​​​​.

You can delete any number of characters in s to make s balanced. s is balanced if there is no pair of indices (i,j) such that i < j and s[i] = 'b' and s[j]= 'a'.

Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make s balanced.

APPROACH:
find where the first b is, find where the last a is
count how many b's between the first b and the last a
count how many a's between the first b and the last a
