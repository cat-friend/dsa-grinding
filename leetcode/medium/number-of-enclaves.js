/**
 * You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.
 *
 * A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.
 *
 * Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * m == grid.length
 * n == grid[i].length
 * 1 <= m, n <= 500
 * grid[i][j] is either 0 or 1.
