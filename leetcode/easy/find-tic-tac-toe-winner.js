/*
Instructions:
return winner of game is winner exists
if draw, return "Draw"
if  there are still movements to play, return "Pending"
APPROACH:
- identify what constitutes a winner
- separate moves into A vs B
- see if either player wins
- determine if there are still moves to play (no winner and < 9 moves)

probably turn moves of A and moves of B into their own object, compare against properties of the win conditions
